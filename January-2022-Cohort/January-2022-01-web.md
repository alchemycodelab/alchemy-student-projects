### Break Beasts

> Description
>
> > BreakBeast is a web application to help Alchemy students manage their time while coding. Without effective time management we often find ourselves not having the rest we need to preform at our best. With BreakBeast we hope to mitigate these problems and help provide alternative breaks to scrolling on your phone. BreakBeast provides a timer to track the time since your last break, a feature to start a 15 min countdown for when you run into errors, as well as break options that include yoga, meditation, and music, and finally a stats page to see your break stats for the day.

### Whiskepedia

> Description 
>>The Whiskepedia app is for finding and researching whiskeys. Visitors to the site will be able to search according to the flavors that work best for their palate. This solves the problem that can happen when non-expert whiskey drinkers are confronted with a barrage of whiskeys and they are unfamiliar with the brands and styles. The app is connected to a postgres database loaded with data from the WhiskeyProject's whiskey api. The server managing the database queries is built using Node.js and express. The front end is vanilla Javascript.

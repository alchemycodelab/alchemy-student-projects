### PDX Secret Menu

> Description 
>>PDX Secret Menu is here to help both hungry Portland foodies and restaurant owners during these strange times! As local restaurants are currently unable to open for dine-in service, many owners are re-evaluating their business models and beginning to offer new formats of take-out options. PDX Secret Menu allows restaurants to sign up and register their businesses, populate current offerings, and create polls to find out what foodies are interested in seeing from them in the future. Foodies are also able to sign up, vote on polls, and purchase live offerings for scheduled pickup from their favorite restaurants. Tech used: React with Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, integrations with Google Maps and Stripe.

### Clear Skies

> Description 
>>Clear Skies is an app designed by amateur astronomers eager to help other budding astronomers explore the vast expanse of our universe. We strive to make the app as user-friendly as possible and provide useful tips throughout to help guide new astronomers on their star-gazing adventures.

The name of our app was inspired by the colloquial sign-off amongst the astronomy community. By saying "Clear Skies" you are wishing for the other astronomers to have a clear view of the skies when they go out stargazing.

Visitors can browse various high-definition photos from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day, create their own account to plan their own star-gazing adventure, store their personal observations to their own catalog to keep track of their progress, and even get a personalized virtual sky map displayed for their location.

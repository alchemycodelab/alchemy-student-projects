### Angle On
> Description 
>> Angle On is a full-stack application that allows filmmakers from underrepresented communities to request support through donations. We integrated OAuth to utilize Google's authentication process and to create a seamless login experience. We create our own cookie for additional control over session length and storage. Each user profile has its own registration, application, and dashboard. An AWS S3 bucket hosts our image URLs so they can be transferred and stored in our relational database. React Hooks | NodeJS | Express | PostgreSQL | AWS S3 | Google OAuth | Material UI

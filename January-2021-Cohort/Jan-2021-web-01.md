### Forgotten Logic

> Description 
>>Forgotten Logic is a puzzle game app; in its current form its main feature is an 8-tile sliding number puzzle, though there is infrastructure in place for more logic puzzles to be added.

While it may not seem so, there are actual health benefits that logic puzzles provide. They stimulate intricate parts of the brain that do not usually get exercised, encourage systematic thinking, boost brain activity and are pivitol in child development.

Resources Used
Our animations come from Animate.css - the script is included in the HTML files.

The tile movement map is based on Danish Mughal's Sliding Puzzle.
